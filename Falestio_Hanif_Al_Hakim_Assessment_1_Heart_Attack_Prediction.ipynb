        "Dataset Prediksi Risiko Serangan Jantung berfungsi sebagai sumber daya berharga untuk mempelajari dinamika rumit kesehatan jantung dan prediktornya. Serangan jantung, atau infark miokard, terus menjadi masalah kesehatan global yang signifikan, sehingga memerlukan pemahaman lebih dalam mengenai faktor-faktor pemicunya dan potensi faktor mitigasinya. Dataset ini merangkum beragam atribut termasuk usia, kadar kolesterol, tekanan darah, kebiasaan merokok, pola olahraga, preferensi makanan, dan banyak lagi, yang bertujuan untuk menjelaskan interaksi kompleks dari variabel-variabel ini dalam menentukan kemungkinan serangan jantung. Dengan menggunakan analisis prediktif dan pembelajaran mesin pada Dataset ini, para peneliti dan profesional kesehatan dapat bekerja menuju strategi proaktif untuk pencegahan dan pengelolaan penyakit jantung. Dataset ini merupakan bukti upaya kolektif untuk meningkatkan pemahaman kita tentang kesehatan kardiovaskular dan membuka jalan menuju masa depan yang lebih sehat.\n",

        "Dataset ini menyediakan serangkaian fitur komprehensif yang relevan dengan kesehatan jantung dan pilihan gaya hidup, yang mencakup detail spesifik pasien seperti usia, jenis kelamin, kadar kolesterol, tekanan darah, detak jantung, dan indikator seperti diabetes, riwayat keluarga, kebiasaan merokok, obesitas, dan konsumsi alkohol. Selain itu, faktor gaya hidup seperti jam olahraga, kebiasaan makan, tingkat stres, dan jam duduk juga disertakan. Aspek medis yang meliputi masalah jantung sebelumnya, penggunaan obat-obatan, dan kadar trigliserida juga dipertimbangkan. Aspek sosial ekonomi seperti pendapatan dan atribut geografis seperti negara, benua, dan belahan bumi dimasukkan. Dataset tersebut, yang terdiri dari 8.763 catatan pasien di seluruh dunia, menghasilkan fitur klasifikasi biner penting yang menunjukkan ada atau tidaknya risiko serangan jantung, sehingga menyediakan sumber daya komprehensif untuk analisis prediktif dan penelitian di bidang kesehatan kardiovaskular.\n",
